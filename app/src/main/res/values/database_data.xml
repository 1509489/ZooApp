    <string-array name="animal_description">
        <item>Sumatran tigers have webbed paws, which means that they\re brilliant swimmers.
            Sumatran tigers are the smallest of all tigers and their low stance lets them creep up
            on prey unseen. Their stripes are narrower and closer together than those of other tigers.</item>

        <item>Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around, they spend between 16 and 20 hours each day resting and sleeping.
            They have few sweat glands so they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the day to
            conserve their energy at night for when it is cooler. </item>
